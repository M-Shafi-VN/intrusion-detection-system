# RT-IoT2022: A Real-Time IoT Network Traffic Dataset

## Overview

RT-IoT2022 is a comprehensive dataset derived from a real-time IoT infrastructure. It integrates data from a diverse range of IoT devices with sophisticated network attack methodologies, offering a detailed perspective on both normal and adversarial network behaviors.

## Key Features

- **Diverse IoT Device Data:**  
  The dataset includes traffic from various IoT devices such as:
  - **ThingSpeak-LED**
  - **Wipro-Bulb**
  - **MQTT-Temp**

- **Realistic Attack Scenarios:**  
  Simulated attack scenarios encompass:
  - **Brute-Force SSH Attacks**
  - **DDoS Attacks** using Hping and Slowloris
  - **Nmap Scanning Patterns**

- **Bidirectional Traffic Capture:**  
  Network communications are captured in both directions using the Zeek network monitoring tool in conjunction with the Flowmeter plugin, ensuring a comprehensive view of network flows.

## Purpose and Applications

RT-IoT2022 is designed to mimic real-world network scenarios in IoT environments, making it an ideal resource for:
